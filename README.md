# Resourses-Databases
The repository is used to learn the workflow of Git and GitHub and is intended to store resourses as my databases.
I am fascinated by the computer science. I am convinced that I can self teach myself with the help of the wonderful resources of computer science on the internet. Be persistent, work smart and then work hard.
